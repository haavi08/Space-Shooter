## How it Works?
### Space Shooter is a game where the player (spaceship) can move left and right using the arrow keys 
### and also fire bullets using the spacebar to shoot down the aliens coming to invade the Earth.
### A 60 second timer will be set each time a new game starts.
### A score will be counted for each alien shot.
### A high score record also appears below the score.
